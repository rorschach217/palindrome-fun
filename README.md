# palindrome-fun
funny experiment with math.

## Fun fact about numbers
if you take any number and reverse it and add them both together, you will find new number.
and if you repeat this process eventually you will find a palindrome bumber.
Example
354 + 453 = 807
807 + 708 = 1515
1515 + 5151 = 6666

# But for sum reason 196 bumber is contravertial. try it in above html
